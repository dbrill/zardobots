simple robots for fun

## Hello world
Start here! Blink an LED. This will verify that we have a working toolchain.

## Button test
add a button to test input functionality

## Monitor sensor
test analog input and serial debug output

## servo test
move a servo through a full range of angles, calibrate if needed

## Time timer
Timer system to show time. Time is the deal here. Like a Time Timer but with a more inscrutable interface.

## Light Follower
Uses two LDR sensors in voltage divider configuration to generate an analog signal proportional to the illumination difference between them. With an error correction loop a servo can be used to steer the sensor pod toward or away from a light source.

## Zardoz! (bonus round)
Use digital signal filters and a microphone input to control the wobbling head and glowing eyes of everyone's favorite late stage post futuristic floating apocalyptic murder idol.


## Tool Setup
