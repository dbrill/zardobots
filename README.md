# zardobots
simple robots based on Xiao Arduino and mini servos, with analog sensing

#code variants

## Light Follower
Uses two LDR sensors in voltage divider configuration to generate an analog signal proportional to the illumination difference between them. With an error correction loop a servo can be used to steer the sensor pod toward or away from a light source.

## Zardoz!
Use digital signal filters an a microphone input to control the wobbling head and glowing eyes of everyone's favorite late stage post futuristic floating apocalyptic murder idol.

## The Count
Timer system to show time. Time is the deal here. Like a Time Timer but with a more inscrutable interface.
